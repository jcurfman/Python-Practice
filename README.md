# Python-Practice
Various scripts written in python as I teach myself the language. All written with/for Python 3.6.

GuessNumber.py
A simple script that simply picks a random number between 1 and 256 and challenges you to guess it, giving you feedback on whether the guess was high or low.

Hangman.py
First script in which I've used the class/function setup. Requires the file list.txt to be in the same working directory in order to pull words from. 

TurnBasedBattle.py
A rough and dirty script developing a classic turn based RPG battle system, like in Pokemon or Final Fantasy. Also a first try at developing an ASCII interface.
